[Abstract](/data/abstract.pdf)  
[Masterthesis](/data/expanded_np_chemspace.pdf)

This thesis was carried out at UniFr in the COMMONS Lab <https://www.unifr.ch/bio/en/groups/allard/>.
For six months, I immersed myself in chemical structure expansion using Pickaxe.
In this repository, I have collected all the important scripts from this journey.

All scripts relevant to the MSc thesis ‘Expanded natural product chemspace’ can be found here.  

## scripts
More details about the scripts can be found in the jupyter-lab files.  
(expanded-naturalproduct-chemspace/*)  


[LOTUS overview](/data/01_LOTUS_overview.ipynb):  
Read in the data from LOTUS (the file has some errors, why there is a specific way).

[MINES Input](/data/02_MINES_input_files.ipynb):  
Analyzing the Inputdata from Lotus and reaction rules.

[MINES lists](/data/03_MINES_reactions.ipynb):  
Script for getting columns of interest. Specifically reactions.

[MINES validation](/data/04_MINES_validation.ipynb):  
scripts for validate SMILES in PubChem. (Didn't work with a big dataset)

[MINES taxonomy search](/data/05_LOTUS_MINES_taxonomy_search.ipynb):  
Lot of different scripts. Annotating the LOTUS db with the output from pickaxe.

[Plots](/data/06_general_plots_for_thesis.ipynb):  
Creating the plots for the master thesis can be found here.
